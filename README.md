Country Innovation Index Analysis


The purpose of this project is to gain insights with regard to the following research questions:
1-	What common drivers behind countries improving or deteriorating substantially with regard to their innovation levels may be identified?
2-	 In what manner are the innovation indices as well as their underlying drivers correlated? 
3-	Are innovation indices published by an official EU organization biased in a way that they rather favor European countries?

The data of interest is a collection of data from four different sources (all datasets are useable free of charge for non-commercial purposes):

•	Global Innovation Index (GII):  2013 – 2021 (Main Source)
•	Bloomberg Innovation Index (BII):  2016 – 2021 (Alternative Source for comparison)
•	European Innovation Scoreboard (EIS):  2014 – 2021 (Alternative Source for comparison)
•	OECD Business Innovation Statistics:  2013 – 2019 (Alternative Source for comparison)

The data mainly includes information about the factors that determine innovation; such as political environment, business environment, education and research, Information and communication technologies.
